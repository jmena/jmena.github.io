        <li>Message passing concurrency</li>
        <li>Distributed systems</li>
        <li>Imperative programming</li>
    </ul>

    Experience with:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Java (12+ years)</li>
        <li>C/C++ (15+ years)</li>
        <li>Erlang (11 months)</li>
        <li>Mozart/Oz (4+ years)</li>
        <li>Scheme (5+ years)</li>
        <li>SQL (5+ years)</li>
        <li>I've focused my efforts in
            mastering the programming languages concepts, specially in the previous languages, however I
            know other languages like python and groovy but I'm not fluent.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Other skills related to computer systems</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Experience with several open source RDBMS: MySql, Postgres</li>
        <li>Experience with non-relational database systems: Riak, MongoDB.
        </li>
        <li>Linux: very good user, basic knowledge of scripting (bash, python, scripts in general, etc.).
            Have basic knowledge of system administration and application deployment.

        <li>Amazon Web Services (mostly with EC2, S3 via API)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>My interests are:</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>Agile software development: how can we develop projects on-time? I'm always looking for methods
            to enhance the productivity and the achievement of goals.
        </li>

        <li>MapReduce: I've been looking for a project where I can work with MapReduce or a similar
            implementation (like hadoop or couchdb).
        </li>

        <li>GPU processing: I love how GPUs can process a huge amount of data in a short amount of time. I'd
            like to find a project where I can use them to crush numbers. Also that's perfect opportunity to
            have a high-end GPU to play games :)
        </li>

        <li>
            Software for people: I love when real people use the systems I've develop. The best compliment
            for me, is when somebody uses something made by me and says: wow!
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Hobbies:</strong> Games, reading, learning new things

    <p>
        This is a company we founded in 2007. I'm still part of the company and sometimes I still write some
        lines of code.
    </p>

    <p>
        This projects has been a great sandbox for learning new technologies, we created a solver for a
        problem called the rich pickup and delivery problem with time windows (rpdptw) which is a superset
        of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem">vrptw</a>. This was my project
        trying to resolve a real life problem.

        Recently we changed a part of the system from a RDBMS (postgres) to a no-sql (MongoDB) implementation and the
        result was very satisfactory, execution speed was enhanced a lot.

    <h3 id="experience4">Lecturer at <a href="http://www.univalle.edu.co/">Universidad del Valle</a> and <a
            href="http://www.javerianacali.edu.co/">Universidad Javeriana Cali</a> (February 2006 - December
        2012)</h3>

    <p>
        I've been a lecturer for several courses in those two universities. Here are the more relevant:

    <ul>
        <li>Models, Techniques and Concepts of programmings languages: In this course for advanced students I taught
            different programming paradigms. With focus in concurrency, message passing concurrency (a la erlang).
            The <strong>Mozart/Oz</strong> is a powerful multi-paradigm programming language which support a lot of
            programming
            models (paradigms) among them object programming (Java/C++), <strong>functional</strong> (lisp, scheme, ML),
            logic
            programming (prolog), among others. I taught this course 2 times.
        </li>

        <li>
            Essentials of programming languages: how to <strong>create programming languages</strong>. We used scheme as
            the
            programming language in which the interpreter was created. I taught this course 2 times, and was previously
            professor's assistant for 2 times.
        </li>

        <li>
            Introduction to algorithms: data structures, big-O notation, mathematical induction, dynamic programming and
            basic optimization. Students could choose any programming language to develop projects, but they usually
            choose Java.
        </li>

        <li>
            Complexity and optimization: more big-O notation, resolution of hard problems (NP problems). Students could
            choose any programming language to develop projects, but they usually choose Java.
        </li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="experience5">Time tabling project (August 2005 - December 2005)</h3><br>

    <p>
        I lead a team for developing a system for timetabling university courses. This was my first experience as
        developer leader. We used a library called <a href="http://www.gecode.org/">Gecode</a> written in C++.
    </p>

    <p>
        Skills required:

    <ul>
        <li>Strong C++</li>
        <li>Constraints programming</li>
        <li>Algorithms optimization</li>
    </ul>
